# breakout
A simple Unity3d breakout clone to learn the ropes in Unity, Blender and working as a small team on assets and code.

Current short term goals are:
- Add power ups.
- Smooth out paddle feel for both joystick and keyboard.
- Write an engine to layout bricks programmatically rather than building large collections of preplaced bricks.
- Design additional levels, and decide how to transition between them.  
      -E.g. all in 1 large terrain, and the player flys between them perhaps?
      
Long term goals:
- Paddle upgrades
- Scoring system with a highscore menu (online?)
- Level editor to allow custom shareable levels.
- Cohesive and themed graphics.
